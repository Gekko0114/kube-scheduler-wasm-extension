## Examples

These examples help you understand how you build your wasm plugins with our Go SDK (which is the only language SDK supported for now).
Each example takes a different approach, refer to README in them for the details.

- [NodeNumber Plugin](./nodenumber/): The simple example plugin in which you can simply get how the wasm plugin looks like.
- [Adbanced NodeNumber Plugin](./advanced/): The example plugin one step advanced, which is more complicated than the first one, but more efficient and testable.
